# Heart_Disease_prediction
A machine learning project that predicts heart disease using medical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, ECG results, and more. Implements Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, and Decision Tree models with data preprocessing, analysis, and result comparison.

# Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading global health issues. Early prediction can save lives.
This project applies multiple ML algorithms to analyze medical data and identify patients at higher risk.

# Implemented Algorithms

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree

# Dataset

Contains 14 key medical features

Target variable: Heart Disease (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

# Steps in the Project
